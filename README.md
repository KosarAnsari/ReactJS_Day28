ðŸš€ Day 28 - Learning ReactJS

Today I dug deeper into API methods and how to integrate them with React. This helped me understand how the frontend communicates with the backend and how to handle data dynamically.


---

ðŸ“Œ What I Learned

The difference between HTTP methods:

GET â†’ Fetch data

POST â†’ Add new data

PUT/PATCH â†’ Update existing data

DELETE â†’ Remove data


Using useParams to get dynamic IDs from the URL.

Fetching user details from a JSON Server API.

Updating React states (useState) with fetched data.

Using useEffect to load API data when the component mounts.




ðŸ“¸ Output Preview

Fetching user details dynamically from API.

Populating data into fields for edit/update/delete functionality.

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Implement PUT method to update user details.

Add a DELETE method to remove users.

Create a complete CRUD app with React + JSON Server.

âœ… This practice gave me a strong foundation in working with APIs in React and handling dynamic data flow.
